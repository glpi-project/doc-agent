Network inventory
=================

A network inventory task aims to retrieve exhaustive information from
SNMP compatible devices, such as network devices or printers, already part of
the list of known assets.

This task can only be performed on devices already part of the list of known
assets, either as a result of a previous :doc:`Network discovery task <./network-discovery>`,
or manually created, with proper SNMP credentials.

Overview
--------

This task uses SNMP to retrieve various information from a device, so as to
update it in GLPI:

* consumable levels and print counter on printers
* virtual LANs definition, network topology, network ports status on network devices

Running
-------

Pre-requisite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The agent performing the task needs to have the NetInventory module installed.

The agent performing the task needs network access the target devices, with
proper access control: just being able to send UDP packets to a device is not
enough, if this device is configured to ignore them.

.. _snmpv3-caution:

.. caution::

   If a device requires SNMP v3 access, you may need to install **Crypt::Rijndael** perl module.
   This module is not installed by default with the agent on linux systems. On a debian-based
   system, you just have to run ``apt install libcrypt-rijndael-perl``. On a RPM-based system,
   running ``dnf install perl-Crypt-Rijndael`` is the right command.

The target device should be associated with proper SNMP credentials in GLPI.

As for any other server controlled task, the agent should use either managed or
half-managed mode, as explained in :ref:`execution-modes`. If
the task is server-triggered, the agent must run in managed mode, and
its HTTP port should be reachable from the server.

Command-line execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A network inventory task can be also performed without a GLPI server, allowing
easier control and troubleshooting, with the :doc:`../man/glpi-netinventory` command-line tool.

However, this command generates files which will have to be injected in GLPI server
using :doc:`../man/glpi-injector` command.
